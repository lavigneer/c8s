# Tasks: Local Kubernetes Development Tooling with Tilt

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-implement-tilt-or/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md
**Status**: Ready for implementation

**Organization**: Tasks organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) to enable independent implementation and incremental delivery.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: User story ID (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- File paths are absolute from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for Tilt integration

**Checkpoint**: Tilt structure and documentation foundation in place

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [ ] T009 [P] Create Docker build configuration for `webhook` image in Tiltfile (references existing `Dockerfile` and `cmd/webhook/`)
- [ ] T010 Configure k3d cluster creation in Tiltfile (or document manual k3d setup)
- [ ] T011 [P] Configure Kubernetes resource deployment in Tiltfile (CRDs, RBAC, component manifests from `deploy/`)
- [ ] T012 Implement environment validation in Tiltfile (check Docker, k3d, kubectl availability)
- [ ] T013 Configure resource limits and constraints for local development (CPU, memory per component)
- [ ] T014 Implement error handling and helpful messages for setup failures

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all three C8S components buildable and deployable via Tilt

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Developer Manages Sample Deployments (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Developer can easily deploy and manage sample pipelines to test multi-component integration

**Independent Test**:
1. Deploy sample pipelines from `config/samples/` using Tilt
2. Verify all samples are created in cluster

  - [ ] T059a SC-001: Setup in < 5 minutes - test on minimum spec machine
  - [ ] T059b SC-002: Change detection < 30 seconds - time rebuild cycles
  - [ ] T059c SC-003: Build failure reporting < 10 seconds - measure error display latency

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
2. **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - BLOCKS all user stories
3. **Phase 3 (US1 - P1)**: Depends on Phase 2 - MVP core functionality
4. **Phase 4 (US2 - P1)**: Depends on Phase 2, can start when Phase 3 begun (independent feature)
5. **Phase 5 (US3 - P2)**: Depends on Phase 2, can start after Phase 4 or in parallel with it
6. **Phase 6 (US4 - P2)**: Depends on Phase 2, can run parallel with US3 or US2
7. **Phase 7 (US5 - P3)**: Depends on Phase 2, can run parallel with other stories or last
8. **Phase 8 (Documentation & Edge Cases)**: Depends on all stories, finalizes implementation
9. **Phase 9 (Polish & Integration)**: Depends on Phase 8, final validation

### Within-Phase Dependencies

**Phase 1**: No dependencies - all can run parallel with [P]

**Phase 2**:
- T006 (base Tiltfile) must run before T007-T009 (component builds)
- T010 (k3d config) can run parallel with T007-T009
- T011 (resource deployment) depends on T006
- T012-T014 can run after T006

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T015 (file watching config) must be before T016-T018 (component rebuild)
- T021 (startup order) must be before final testing T022
- Can proceed when Phase 2 complete

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T024 (validation helper) before T025 (schema validation)
- T025 before T028 (error reporting)
- T026 (file watching) parallel with T024-T025
- Can start immediately after T024 framework is in place

**Phase 5-7 (US3-5)**:
- No internal dependencies, can start after Phase 2

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Setup (Phase 1)**:
```
T001 (Tiltfile creation)
T002, T003, T004, T005 [P] (documentation & contracts)
```

**Foundational (Phase 2)**:
```
T006 (base Tiltfile)
‚îú‚îÄ T007, T008, T009 [P] (Docker configs for all components)
‚îú‚îÄ T010 [P] (k3d setup)
‚îú‚îÄ T011 (resource deployment)
‚îú‚îÄ T012, T013, T014 [P] (validation, constraints, errors)
```

**User Stories in Parallel** (after Phase 2):
```
Developer A: Phase 3 (US1 - hot reload) - Critical for MVP
Developer B: Phase 4 (US2 - validation) - Can start when Phase 3 begun
Developer C: Phase 5 (US3 - samples) - Can start when Phase 2 complete
```

## Success Criteria Validation

Each user story addresses specific success criteria from spec.md:

- **US1 (Hot Reload)** ‚Üí SC-001, SC-002, SC-003
- **US2 (Pipeline Validation)** ‚Üí SC-004, SC-007
- **US3 (Sample Management)** ‚Üí SC-005

## Notes

- [P] tasks can run in parallel (different files, no code dependencies)
- [Story] label enables traceability and independent completion tracking
- Each phase should be independently testable and deployable
- Commit after each task or logical group (as requested)
- Update `CLAUDE.md` after feature completion
- Tilt handles file watching natively - no custom implementation needed
- Dashboard/UI provided by Tilt - no custom tooling required
- All paths assume repository root at `/Users/elavigne/workspace/c8s`
