# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Kubernetes Development Tooling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results Summary

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - READY FOR PLANNING

All ambiguities resolved:
- 5 user stories with prioritization and independent test criteria
- 12 functional requirements (all unambiguous)
- 8 measurable success criteria
- Edge cases identified and documented
- Assumptions clearly stated

### Clarifications Applied

**Session 2025-10-22**:
- Pipeline validation scope clarified: Both syntax AND semantic validation against CRD schema (FR-007)
- Validation includes field types, constraints, and required fields checking
- Enables comprehensive error detection during development with clear feedback to developers
