# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Test Environment Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated:

- **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on what developers need (local test environment) and why (fast iteration, no cloud costs), without prescribing specific technologies beyond necessary dependencies
- **Requirement Completeness**: All 12 functional requirements are testable, edge cases are identified, scope is clearly bounded with in/out sections, and reasonable assumptions are documented
- **Feature Readiness**: Four prioritized user stories provide comprehensive coverage from cluster creation through teardown, with independent test criteria for each

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- No clarifications needed - all reasonable defaults were inferred based on standard Kubernetes development practices
- The choice of specific local cluster tool (kind/minikube/k3d) is appropriately deferred to implementation phase
