# Specification Quality Checklist: Kubernetes-Native Continuous Integration System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Details**:
- All 30 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 5 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- 12 measurable success criteria, all technology-agnostic
- 6 edge cases identified for consideration during planning
- Clear dependencies (Kubernetes, container registry, VCS, etc.)
- Assumptions documented (cluster version, user familiarity, etc.)
- Out of scope clearly defined (CD pipelines, Windows support, etc.)
- No implementation details mentioned (pure requirements focus)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all reasonable defaults applied

**Notes**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All quality criteria met without requiring iterations
- Feature scope is well-bounded with clear success metrics
