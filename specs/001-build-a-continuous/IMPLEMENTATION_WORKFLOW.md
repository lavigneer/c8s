# Implementation Workflow: Per-Task Git Commits

**Feature**: 001-build-a-continuous
**Date**: 2025-10-12

## Overview

This document defines the git commit workflow for implementing the 89 tasks in tasks.md. Each completed task will receive a dedicated git commit for clean history and easy rollback.

---

## Commit Strategy

### One Commit Per Task

**Rule**: Each task (T001-T089) gets exactly ONE commit when completed.

**Benefits**:
- Clean, granular git history
- Easy to identify when specific functionality was added
- Easy to rollback individual tasks if needed
- Clear progress tracking via git log
- Supports code review at task level

---

## Commit Message Format

### Standard Format

```
[T###] Short task description

Detailed description:
- What was implemented
- Files created/modified
- Any important decisions made

User Story: [US#] (if applicable)
Phase: # - Phase Name
```

### Examples

**Example 1: Setup Task**
```
[T001] Initialize Go module and project structure

Created initial directory structure and Go module:
- Initialized go.mod with Go 1.25
- Created cmd/, pkg/, tests/, config/, web/, deploy/ directories
- Established standard Go project layout per plan.md

Phase: 1 - Setup & Project Initialization
```

**Example 2: Implementation Task**
```
[T025] Implement Job creation from PipelineStep

Created job_manager.go with Job generation logic:
- CreateJobForStep() generates K8s Job from PipelineStep
- Init container for git clone
- Main container with step.image and commands
- Resource requests/limits from step.resources
- Owner reference for garbage collection
- TTL configured for automatic cleanup

User Story: US1 - Basic Pipeline Execution
Phase: 3 - User Story 1
Files: pkg/controller/job_manager.go
```

**Example 3: Test Task**
```
[T042] Write unit tests for DAG scheduler

Added comprehensive test coverage for scheduler:
- Test cases: empty steps, single step, linear dependencies
- Test cases: parallel steps, complex DAG
- Test cases: circular dependency detection, invalid references
- Uses testify for assertions

User Story: US1 - Basic Pipeline Execution
Phase: 3 - User Story 1
Files: tests/unit/scheduler_test.go
```

---

## Commit Workflow

### For Each Task

1. **Start Task**: Reference tasks.md for task details (T###)
2. **Implement**: Write code, tests, docs per task description
3. **Verify**: Ensure task acceptance criteria met
4. **Stage Changes**: `git add <files>`
5. **Commit**: Use format above with task number
6. **Move to Next**: Proceed to next task in dependency order

### Commands

```bash
# After completing task T001
git add go.mod cmd/ pkg/ tests/ config/ web/ deploy/
git commit -m "[T001] Initialize Go module and project structure

Created initial directory structure and Go module:
- Initialized go.mod with Go 1.25
- Created cmd/, pkg/, tests/, config/, web/, deploy/ directories
- Established standard Go project layout per plan.md

Phase: 1 - Setup & Project Initialization"

# After completing task T025
git add pkg/controller/job_manager.go
git commit -m "[T025] Implement Job creation from PipelineStep

Created job_manager.go with Job generation logic:
- CreateJobForStep() generates K8s Job from PipelineStep
- Init container for git clone
- Main container with step.image and commands
- Resource requests/limits from step.resources
- Owner reference for garbage collection
- TTL configured for automatic cleanup

User Story: US1 - Basic Pipeline Execution
Phase: 3 - User Story 1
Files: pkg/controller/job_manager.go"
```

---

## Checkpoint Commits

At the end of each phase, create a checkpoint commit summarizing progress:

```
[CHECKPOINT] Phase # - Phase Name Complete

Summary:
- # tasks completed (T###-T###)
- Key deliverables: ...
- User Story # deliverable achieved (if applicable)

Next: Phase # - Phase Name
```

**Example**:
```
[CHECKPOINT] Phase 1 - Setup & Project Initialization Complete

Summary:
- 12 tasks completed (T001-T012)
- Project structure established
- Development tooling configured
- CI/CD pipeline ready

Next: Phase 2 - Foundational Infrastructure
```

---

## Git History Structure

Expected git log structure:

```
* [CHECKPOINT] Phase 7 - Parallel Execution Complete
* [T089] Write integration test for matrix execution
* [T088] Write integration test for parallel execution
* [T087] Update dashboard to show matrix executions
...
* [CHECKPOINT] Phase 3 - User Story 1 Complete (MVP)
* [T044] Write integration test for basic pipeline execution
* [T043] Write unit tests for pipeline parser
...
* [CHECKPOINT] Phase 2 - Foundational Infrastructure Complete
* [T022] Setup RBAC manifests for controller
* [T021] Implement pipeline YAML parser
...
* [CHECKPOINT] Phase 1 - Setup Complete
* [T012] Document development workflow
* [T011] Setup envtest for integration testing
...
* [T001] Initialize Go module and project structure
* Initial commit (planning artifacts)
```

## Handling Multiple Files

When a task modifies many files, list the key ones in commit message:

```
[T016] Generate CRD manifests and DeepCopy methods

Generated CRD YAML files and DeepCopy implementations:
- Created pkg/apis/v1alpha1/groupversion_info.go
- Generated config/crd/bases/c8s.dev_pipelineconfigs.yaml
- Generated config/crd/bases/c8s.dev_pipelineruns.yaml
- Generated config/crd/bases/c8s.dev_repositoryconnections.yaml
- Generated pkg/apis/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go
- Verified CRDs match data-model.md schemas

Phase: 2 - Foundational Infrastructure
Files: config/crd/bases/*, pkg/apis/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go
```

---

## Handling Parallel Tasks

When multiple tasks marked [P] are done in parallel:

1. Each developer works on separate task branches (optional)
2. Each task gets individual commit
3. Merge/rebase to maintain task order numbering
4. Keep commits atomic (one task = one commit)

**Example Timeline**:
```
Developer A: T023 ‚Üí commit ‚Üí T024 ‚Üí commit
Developer B: T029 ‚Üí commit ‚Üí T030 ‚Üí commit
Developer C: T035 ‚Üí commit ‚Üí T036 ‚Üí commit

All merge to main, maintaining T### ordering
```

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Revert Single Task
```bash
# Revert task T025 if bugs found
git log --grep="T025"  # Find commit hash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Rollback to Checkpoint
```bash
# Rollback entire Phase 3
git log --grep="CHECKPOINT.*Phase 2"  # Find Phase 2 checkpoint
git reset --hard <checkpoint-commit-hash>
```

---

## Progress Tracking

### Check Completed Tasks
```bash
# List all completed tasks
git log --oneline --grep="^\[T[0-9]"

# Count completed tasks
git log --oneline --grep="^\[T[0-9]" | wc -l

# Check which phase we're in
git log --oneline --grep="CHECKPOINT" | head -1
```

### Verify All Files Committed
```bash
# Should be clean after each task
git status
```

---

## Automated Workflow (Future Enhancement)

Potential automation with git hooks or task runner:

```bash
# Hypothetical command
./run-task.sh T001

# Would:
# 1. Load task T001 description from tasks.md
# 2. Present task details
# 3. Wait for implementation
# 4. Run tests if task includes tests
# 5. Auto-generate commit message from task
# 6. Prompt for confirmation
# 7. Commit with standard format
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Commit after each task completes
‚úÖ Include task number [T###] in commit message
‚úÖ Add brief description of what was implemented
‚úÖ List key files created/modified
‚úÖ Tag user story if applicable
‚úÖ Create checkpoint commits at phase boundaries
‚úÖ Keep commits atomic (one task, one commit)

### DON'T:
‚ùå Combine multiple tasks in one commit
‚ùå Commit partial task implementation (wait until task complete)
‚ùå Skip task numbers or reorder
‚ùå Forget to verify tests pass before committing
‚ùå Commit generated files without documenting generation method
‚ùå Use vague commit messages

---

## Implementation Start Command

When ready to begin implementation:

```bash
# Ensure we're on feature branch
git checkout 001-build-a-continuous

# Confirm planning artifacts committed
git log --oneline -5

# Begin Phase 1, Task T001
# After completing T001:
git add <files>
git commit -m "[T001] Initialize Go module and project structure
...
"

# Continue with T002, T003, etc.
```

## Summary

**89 tasks** = **89 commits** + **7 checkpoint commits** = **96 total commits** for complete implementation

This provides:
- Granular history
- Easy rollback
- Clear progress tracking
- Individual task review capability
- Clean git log for project history

**Ready to begin implementation with clean, tracked commits!** üöÄ
