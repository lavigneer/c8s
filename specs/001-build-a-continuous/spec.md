# Feature Specification: Kubernetes-Native Continuous Integration System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-continuous`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a continuous integration system that relies heavily on kubernetes paradigms and functionality to accomplish the task runs"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Define and Execute Basic CI Pipeline (Priority: P1)

A developer commits code to a repository and wants automated tests to run immediately. The developer defines a pipeline configuration file describing the steps needed (build, test, lint), commits it alongside their code, and the CI system automatically detects the changes, creates isolated execution environments for each step, and reports results back to the developer.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of any CI system - automated testing on code changes. Without this, the system has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a sample repository with a simple pipeline configuration, pushing a commit, and verifying that pipeline steps execute and results are reported. Delivers immediate value by automating the build-test cycle.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a repository with a pipeline configuration file, **When** a developer pushes a commit, **Then** the CI system detects the change and initiates a pipeline run
2. **Given** a pipeline run is initiated, **When** execution begins, **Then** each pipeline step runs in an isolated container environment with proper resource allocation
3. **Given** a pipeline is executing, **When** all steps complete successfully, **Then** the developer receives a success notification with execution logs
4. **Given** a pipeline is executing, **When** any step fails, **Then** execution stops and the developer receives failure details including logs and exit codes
5. **Given** multiple commits are pushed rapidly, **When** pipelines are triggered, **Then** each commit gets its own isolated pipeline run without interference

---

### User Story 2 - Monitor Pipeline Execution and Resource Usage (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to understand what's happening during pipeline execution - which steps are running, how long they take, what resources they consume, and see real-time logs. The developer accesses a dashboard or CLI tool that shows current pipeline status, step-by-step progress, live log streaming, and resource utilization metrics.

**Why this priority**: Observability is critical for debugging failures and optimizing pipeline performance. Without visibility, developers waste time guessing what went wrong.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a multi-step pipeline and verifying that status updates, log streams, and metrics are accessible through both UI and CLI interfaces. Delivers value by reducing debugging time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline is running, **When** a developer queries pipeline status, **Then** they see current state (pending/running/completed), which steps are active, and elapsed time
2. **Given** a pipeline step is executing, **When** a developer requests logs, **Then** they receive real-time streaming logs from that step's container
3. **Given** a pipeline has completed, **When** a developer reviews execution history, **Then** they see duration for each step, resource usage (CPU/memory), and can access archived logs
4. **Given** multiple pipelines are running concurrently, **When** a developer views the system dashboard, **Then** they see all active pipelines with their current status and resource consumption

---

### User Story 3 - Manage Secrets and Configuration (Priority: P2)

A developer needs to run tests that require credentials (API keys, database passwords, certificates) but must not commit these secrets to the repository. The developer defines secret references in the pipeline configuration, an administrator securely stores the actual secret values in the CI system, and during pipeline execution, secrets are securely injected into containers without being logged or exposed.

**Why this priority**: Security is non-negotiable for production CI systems. Without proper secret management, developers either commit secrets to repos (security risk) or cannot test integration scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a pipeline that references secrets (e.g., database password), storing those secrets through the admin interface, running the pipeline, and verifying that the application receives the secret values while logs show masked values. Delivers value by enabling secure testing of integrated systems.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator has stored secrets, **When** a pipeline configuration references those secrets by name, **Then** the secrets are injected as environment variables in the appropriate containers
2. **Given** a pipeline uses secrets, **When** execution logs are generated, **Then** secret values are masked or redacted in all output
3. **Given** a secret is updated, **When** a new pipeline run executes, **Then** it receives the updated secret value without requiring pipeline configuration changes
4. **Given** a developer without admin privileges, **When** they attempt to view secret values, **Then** access is denied while they can still reference secrets in pipeline configurations

### User Story 4 - Optimize Resource Utilization with Workload Scheduling (Priority: P3)

An organization runs hundreds of pipelines daily and wants to maximize infrastructure efficiency. The CI system leverages cluster autoscaling, schedules workloads based on resource requirements and priorities, reuses container images across pipelines, and scales down resources when idle. Operations teams can define resource quotas and limits per team or project.

**Why this priority**: Cost optimization and efficient resource usage become important at scale but aren't blockers for initial adoption. Organizations can start with over-provisioned infrastructure and optimize later.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running multiple pipelines with varying resource requirements, monitoring cluster node scaling behavior, verifying that high-priority pipelines preempt low-priority ones when resources are constrained, and confirming that idle resources scale down. Delivers value by reducing infrastructure costs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple pipelines are queued, **When** cluster resources are insufficient, **Then** the system automatically scales up compute nodes to handle the workload
2. **Given** no pipelines have run for a defined period, **When** the idle timeout elapses, **Then** excess compute nodes are scaled down to minimum capacity
3. **Given** a pipeline specifies resource requirements (CPU/memory), **When** scheduling occurs, **Then** the workload is placed on nodes with sufficient available resources
4. **Given** an organization has defined team quotas, **When** a team's pipelines would exceed their quota, **Then** additional pipeline runs are queued until resources are available within quota limits

---

### User Story 5 - Parallel and Fan-Out Execution (Priority: P3)

A developer has a large test suite that takes 30 minutes to run sequentially but could complete in 5 minutes if parallelized. The developer defines pipeline stages where certain steps can run in parallel (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, and linting all at once), or defines a matrix strategy to run the same tests across multiple configurations (different OS versions, language versions, browser types). The CI system orchestrates these parallel executions and aggregates results.

**Why this priority**: Parallel execution significantly improves developer productivity by reducing feedback time, but the system can deliver value with sequential execution initially. This is an optimization feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a pipeline with parallel stages or matrix strategy, running it, verifying that multiple containers execute simultaneously, and confirming that aggregated results accurately reflect all parallel executions. Delivers value by reducing pipeline duration from minutes to seconds for large test suites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline defines parallel steps, **When** that stage executes, **Then** all parallel steps run simultaneously in separate containers
2. **Given** a pipeline defines a matrix strategy (e.g., 3 OS versions Ã— 2 language versions), **When** execution begins, **Then** 6 parallel workloads are created, one for each matrix combination
3. **Given** parallel steps are executing, **When** one step fails, **Then** other parallel steps continue running but the overall stage is marked as failed
4. **Given** all parallel steps complete, **When** aggregating results, **Then** the developer sees combined status and can access individual logs for each parallel execution

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a pipeline runs for an unexpectedly long time (hours instead of minutes) - should there be timeout limits and how are they enforced?
- How does the system handle a node failure mid-pipeline execution - are in-progress steps retried, moved to another node, or marked as failed?
- What happens when a pipeline is triggered while an identical pipeline (same commit, same configuration) is already running - should it be queued, deduplicated, or run in parallel?
- How does the system handle container image pull failures (network issues, registry unavailable, authentication failures) - retry behavior and fallback strategies?
- What happens when a pipeline is manually cancelled mid-execution - are resources immediately cleaned up, are there grace periods for cleanup steps?
- How does the system handle resource exhaustion (storage for logs and artifacts, IP addresses, persistent volume claims) when running many concurrent pipelines?

### Key Entities

- **Pipeline Configuration**: Defines the structure of a CI workflow including steps, dependencies, resource requirements, secrets, and execution conditions. Can be stored as YAML or similar declarative format in the repository.
- **Pipeline Run**: Represents a single execution instance of a pipeline, triggered by a specific event (commit, tag, manual trigger). Contains execution state, logs, artifacts, duration, and outcome.
- **Pipeline Step**: An individual task within a pipeline (e.g., "run tests", "build container image"). Executes in an isolated container with specified resource limits and can depend on previous steps.
- **Execution Environment**: The containerized runtime where steps execute, including the container image, environment variables, mounted volumes, resource allocations, and network configuration.
- **Secret**: Sensitive data (credentials, API keys, certificates) that must be injected into execution environments securely without being exposed in logs or configurations.
- **Artifact**: Files or data produced by pipeline steps that need to persist beyond the step's execution (test results, build outputs, coverage reports). Can be shared between steps or archived for later access.
- **Workload**: The Kubernetes-native representation of a pipeline step execution (typically a Job or Pod) with associated resource requirements, constraints, and lifecycle management.
- **Repository Connection**: Configuration linking a version control repository to the CI system, including authentication credentials, webhook configuration, and branch/tag filters.
- **Resource Quota**: Limits on compute resources (CPU, memory, storage, concurrent executions) allocated to teams, projects, or individual pipelines to prevent resource exhaustion.

## Assumptions

- Kubernetes cluster (version 1.24+) is already deployed and operational with sufficient permissions for the CI system to create Jobs, Pods, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and PersistentVolumeClaims
- Container image registry is available and accessible from the cluster for pulling step execution images
- Version control systems support webhook notifications for push, pull request, and tag events
- Users have basic familiarity with containerization concepts and YAML configuration syntax
- Network connectivity exists between the cluster and version control systems for webhook delivery and code fetching
- Storage backend (object storage or persistent volumes) is available for storing logs and artifacts
- Organizations will define reasonable resource quotas and timeout values appropriate to their workload patterns
- Standard retention periods (30 days for logs, 90 days for execution history) are acceptable; custom retention is out of scope for initial version
- Authentication and authorization for user access to the CI system will integrate with existing organizational identity providers (OAuth2/OIDC)
- Pipeline configurations will be stored in repositories alongside code rather than in a separate database or configuration management system

## Dependencies

- Kubernetes cluster with autoscaling capabilities (Cluster Autoscaler or equivalent)
- Container image registry (Docker Hub, GCR, ECR, Harbor, or similar)
- Version control system with webhook support (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or similar)
- Secret storage backend (Kubernetes Secrets with optional integration to Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar)
- Object storage or persistent volumes for log and artifact storage
- Identity provider for user authentication (OAuth2/OIDC compatible)

## Out of Scope

- Building or compiling code outside of containers (all build steps must be containerized)
- Direct integration with deployment systems (CD pipelines) - this is a CI system focused on build and test
- Built-in code quality analysis or security scanning tools (these can be added as pipeline steps using third-party tools)
- Visual pipeline editor or drag-and-drop UI (configuration is code-based via YAML)
- Multi-cluster execution where a single pipeline runs across multiple Kubernetes clusters
- Windows container support (initial version focuses on Linux containers)
- Native support for VM-based execution environments (container-only)
- Built-in artifact repository management (organizations must provide their own artifact storage)
- Billing and cost allocation beyond basic resource quota enforcement
