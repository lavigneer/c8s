# C8S (Specify) Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development

Every feature MUST begin with a complete specification before implementation. Features are developed through a structured workflow:

1. **Specification** (`/speckit.specify`): Define user scenarios, requirements, and success criteria
2. **Planning** (`/speckit.plan`): Research, design, and create implementation artifacts
3. **Task Generation** (`/speckit.tasks`): Generate actionable, dependency-ordered tasks
4. **Implementation** (`/speckit.implement`): Execute tasks following the established plan

**Rationale**: Specification-first development ensures alignment between stakeholders, reduces rework, and provides clear success criteria before code is written.

### II. User Story-Driven Architecture

Features MUST be decomposed into prioritized, independently testable user stories (P1, P2, P3...). Each user story:

- Delivers standalone value
- Can be implemented independently
- Can be tested independently
- Can be deployed as an incremental MVP

**Rationale**: Independent user stories enable incremental delivery, parallel development, and continuous validation of value delivery.

### III. Constitution Gates

All implementation plans MUST pass Constitution Check gates before proceeding. Gates validate:

- Architectural simplicity (avoid premature abstraction)
- Complexity justification (document why simpler alternatives were rejected)
- Compliance with project principles

**Rationale**: Proactive gate enforcement prevents technical debt and ensures architectural consistency across the codebase.

### IV. Test Independence

When tests are required, they MUST be:

- Written FIRST before implementation
- Designed to FAIL initially (red-green-refactor)
- Independently executable per user story
- Categorized as contract, integration, or unit tests

**Rationale**: Test-first development ensures testability, validates requirements understanding, and provides regression protection.

### V. Documentation as Artifact

Design artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/) are first-class deliverables:

- Generated systematically through workflow commands
- Version-controlled alongside code
- Kept synchronized through consistency analysis (`/speckit.analyze`)
- Serve as the source of truth for feature intent

**Rationale**: Living documentation reduces knowledge silos, enables effective onboarding, and maintains architectural coherence over time.

## Development Workflow

### Command Workflow

The canonical feature development workflow follows this command sequence:

1. **`/speckit.specify`** - Create or update feature specification from natural language description
2. **`/speckit.clarify`** - Identify and resolve underspecified areas through targeted questions
3. **`/speckit.plan`** - Execute implementation planning (research, design artifacts, contracts)
4. **`/speckit.analyze`** - Perform cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis
5. **`/speckit.tasks`** - Generate actionable, dependency-ordered tasks from design artifacts
6. **`/speckit.implement`** - Execute implementation following the task plan

### Artifact Locations

All feature documentation MUST reside in:

```
specs/[###-feature-name]/
├── spec.md              # Feature specification (user stories, requirements, success criteria)
├── plan.md              # Implementation plan (technical context, structure, constitution check)
├── research.md          # Research findings and technical decisions
├── data-model.md        # Entity definitions, relationships, validation rules
├── contracts/           # API contracts (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas, etc.)
├── tasks.md             # Dependency-ordered implementation tasks
└── quickstart.md        # Quick start guide for developers
```

### Quality Gates

- **Pre-Planning**: Specification must define user scenarios and functional requirements
- **Pre-Implementation**: Constitution Check must pass; all "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" resolved
- **Pre-Deployment**: Success criteria from spec.md must be validated

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Constitution amendments require:

1. **Proposal**: Document proposed changes with rationale
2. **Impact Analysis**: Identify affected templates, commands, and existing features
3. **Sync Propagation**: Update all dependent artifacts (templates, commands, docs)
4. **Version Bump**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
5. **Ratification**: Project owner approval and documentation update

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible principle removals or redefinitions
- **MINOR**: New principles added or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

All code reviews and feature implementations MUST verify:

- Compliance with specification-first workflow
- Constitution Check passage for architectural decisions
- User story independence and testability
- Documentation synchronization with implementation

Violations MUST be documented in plan.md Complexity Tracking table with:
- What principle is violated
- Why the violation is necessary
- Why simpler compliant alternatives were rejected
